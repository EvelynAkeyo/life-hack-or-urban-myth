## How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (Hedgehog or later recommended)
- JDK 17
- Android SDK (API 34)
- An Android emulator or physical device (API 24+)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/life-hack-or-urban-myth.git
   cd life-hack-or-urban-myth
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**
   - Launch Android Studio
   - Select **File → Open** and navigate to the cloned project directory
   - Wait for Gradle sync to complete

3. **Run the app**
   - Select an emulator or connected device
   - Click the **Run ▶** button (or press `Shift + F10`)
   - The app will build and launch on your selected device

4. **Build APK manually (optional)**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```
   The APK will be generated at: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## Design Considerations

### UI Choices
- **Dark theme with deep blue background** — Reduces eye strain and gives a premium, modern feel
- **Amber accent color** — Provides strong contrast against the dark blue for important interactive elements
- **Card-based flashcard layout** — CardView creates a clear visual container for the quiz statement, making it feel like a real flashcard
- **Emoji-enhanced UI** — Emojis add personality and make the app feel approachable without needing custom icons
- **Material Design 3** — Ensures the app follows modern Android design guidelines for consistency

### Flashcard Logic (Loop/Index Approach)
The quiz uses an **index-based iteration** approach rather than recursion:
1. Questions are loaded from `FlashcardData.kt` and **shuffled** at the start of each session
2. A `currentIndex` variable tracks the current question position
3. When the user presses "Next", the index increments (`currentIndex++`)
4. The `displayQuestion()` function reads the flashcard at `flashcards[currentIndex]`
5. When `currentIndex` reaches the end of the list, the quiz navigates to the Score screen

This approach is:
- **Memory efficient** — No recursive call stack buildup
- **State-friendly** — Easy to save/restore `currentIndex` on configuration changes
- **Predictable** — Simple linear flow through the question list

### Score Feedback Thresholds
| Score Range | Tier | Message |
|:-:|:-:|:--|
| ≥ 7 | 🏆 High | "Master Hacker!" |
| 4 – 6 | 👍 Medium | "Great job! Keep it up!" |
| < 4 | 📚 Low | "Stay Safe Online! Keep practising!" |

These thresholds provide encouraging feedback at every level — rewarding high scores while motivating lower scorers to try again.

## ⚙️ GitHub Actions — Automated Build

### What the Workflow Does
The CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) automates the build and test process:

1. **Triggers** on every push and pull request to the `main` branch
2. **Sets up** JDK 17 (Temurin distribution) with Gradle caching for faster builds
3. **Builds** the debug APK using `./gradlew assembleDebug`
4. **Runs** all unit tests using `./gradlew test`
5. **Uploads** the generated APK as a downloadable build artifact

### Why Automated Builds Matter
- **Catches bugs early** — Every push is automatically tested before merging
- **Ensures consistency** — Builds run in a clean, reproducible environment
- **Saves time** — No manual build-test-upload cycle required
- **Team confidence** — Build status badges show project health at a glance

## How to Run Tests

### Run all unit tests
```bash
./gradlew test
```

### Test Coverage
The test suite (`FlashcardUnitTest.kt`) includes:

| # | Test | Description |
|:-:|:--|:--|
| 1 | `flashcard_dataClass_storesValuesCorrectly` | Verifies Flashcard data class stores hack values |
| 2 | `flashcard_dataClass_storesMythCorrectly` | Verifies Flashcard data class stores myth values |
| 3 | `scoreFeedback_returnsCorrectTier` | Tests all three feedback tiers (high/medium/low) |
| 4 | `scoreCalculation_incrementsCorrectly` | Simulates all-correct quiz and validates score |
| 5 | `flashcardData_containsAtLeast10Questions` | Ensures minimum question count |
| 6 | `shuffledFlashcards_containSameElements` | Validates shuffle preserves all questions |
| 7 | `flashcardData_allFieldsNonEmpty` | Checks no empty statements or explanations |
| 8 | `getTotalQuestions_returnsCorrectCount` | Verifies total count function |
| 9 | `scoreCalculation_zeroWhenAllWrong` | Validates zero score on all wrong answers |
| 10 | `flashcard_equalityWorks` | Tests data class equality semantics |
